### Version 2.5.0

### Main Window
- New top-bar menu
  - Moved the old top left buttons
  - Merged the help and about button in one menu button
- There are now 3 resizeable columns.
   - Left column is the standard file explorer with some minor tweaks. Additionally, the `Date Modified` column field is minimized by default. You can resize it.
   - Middle column is the Image Preview with mip and face sliders.
   - Right column contains expanders about image properties, advanced editing options, debug output and conversion menu.

### Image Preview
- Added `Pan and Zoom` feature. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out and the left mouse button to drag the image.
- Added mip and face sliders. They automatically hide if there are no mips or faces presented, respectively. Very useful for cubemaps, arraymaps and volumemaps.

### Right Column

#### Image Properties
- A couple of new fields were added, most notably texture layout and colour space.
- Removed channel count field. It did not always work. For compressed formats, it would be better to search them up in the documentation.
- `Has Alpha` has been renamed to `Has Transparency`.

#### Advanced Options
It contains:
- Combobox containing all games before and including The Walking Dead Season 1. It is used for legacy formats only.
- `Legacy Console` -  if checked, older console textures can be read. The actual texture may be not be read.
- `Auto Compression` - if checked, the converter picks the suitable compression method based on 
- `Auto Normal Maps` - if checked, the converter picks the suitable compression and effects to make normal maps work for Telltale Tool Engine.
- `Enable Mipmaps` - if checked, there will be 2 options: automatic and manual.
   - Automatic will generate the appropriate amount of mips
   - Manual - you can select the number of mips that will be generated.
- `Enable Swizzling` - if checked, there will be a combobox containing different platforms with 2 radio buttons - Swizzle and Deswizzle. These are used for textures from different platforms like PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch.
- `Enable Effects` - if checked, there will be a combobox containing some effects, useful for normal maps.
- `Create Normal Map` - if checked, the texture will be converted to a normal map. Note: The quality is not good at the moment - it might be tweaked in the future.

> [!WARNING] 
> These options apply only in the conversion process. They are not applied to the image itself!

#### Debug Information
- The contents from `Debug Info` button has been moved there. It makes it more consistent and more accessible.

#### Conversion Panel
- The `Conversion Options` has been split into 2 parts - `From` and `To`. It's more flexible and makes bulk conversion easier and more accessible.

### Converter:
- Added Linux and (potentially) MacOS support.
- Added support for reading and writing for every single Telltale game.
- Added support for reading and writing console textures (PS3, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360).
- Added support for reading mobile textures for newer games (iOS and Android).
- Added HDR and TGA support.
- Added support for direct conversion from D3DTX to PNG, JPEG, TGA, HDR, BMP and TIFF, and vice versa.
- Added a new message box which indicates if a bulk conversion was successful or not. (Thanks [Mawrak](https://github.com/Mawrak)!)
- JSON files now contain `GameID` and `PlatformType` fields. `ConversionType` field is no longer used, but left out for backwards compatibility. v2.3.0 JSON files are no longer supported, v2.4.0 JSON files could potentially break in some cases. Please report any issues!
- Removed the option from other file formats to DDS, the advanced options replace that functionality.

### Bugfixes:
> [!WARNING] 
> Because a lot of the UI has changed, bugs are expected.

### Technical Improvements:
- Replaced DirectXTexNet with [Hexa.NET.DirectXTex](https://github.com/HexaEngine/Hexa.NET.DirectXTex). (Thanks [Juna Meinhold](https://github.com/JunaMeinhold), main developer of [Hexa Engine](https://github.com/HexaEngine/HexaEngine)!)

- Bumped all dependencies to their latest versions.
- Removed ImageSharp, Pfim and LibTiff.Net libraries. They are replaced by SkiaSharp and DirectXTex/Hexa.NET.DirectxXTex.

### Version 2.4.0

- Added volumemap texture support (They usually do not exist. Please report if you find any).
- Added support to export a DDS image even if the version is not recognized (it will not generate a JSON file). This is a feature parity with Telltale Explorer and should work for any Telltale game.
