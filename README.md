# DDS-D3DTX-Converter

**This is an experimental application** containing a WIP console script application for converting .d3dtx textures (Telltale Tool Textures), to standard .dds (Direct Draw Surface). It can also do the opposite and can be used to do texture mods for a Telltale Tool Game.

When this script improves and matures, I will turn it into a full on custom application complete with a GUI for better useability and release builds of said tool. For the time being if you wish to try this yourself you are welcome to download this project and run it yourself in the IDE (You will need Visual Studio Community 2020). It's worth mentioning at the time of writing, this is very new and bleeding edge. Expect bugs or issues as anything in the script is still very new.

**NOTE**: This is currently being developed and tested with ***"The Walking Dead Telltale Definitive Series".****

**More information will be revealed and explained at a later date.** *(I will also write another page explaining the extraction/building process and the d3dtx format for those intrested as well. Information is power!)*
