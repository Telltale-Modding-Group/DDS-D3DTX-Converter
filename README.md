This is an application designed for converting **.d3dtx textures (Telltale Tool Textures)**, to standard **.dds (Direct Draw Surface)**. **It can also do the opposite and can be used to do texture mods for a Telltale Tool Game.**

## DISCLAIMER (Please Read)

**NOTE:** Some **.d3dtx** textures will not work or show up properly and might even look corrupted after conversion into **.dds**. This is simply because once again, this is very new and I have yet to support more d3dtx texture variants (there are a lot). For the most part, any regular diffuse/albedo textures should work.

This is currently being developed and tested only with ***"The Walking Dead Telltale Definitive Series"*** textures. (for the time being)

### Limitations

1. Only supports **The Walking Dead Definitive Edition** textures *(for the time being)*
2. Can't upscale or downscale the texture resolution *(for the time being)*
3. Not all textures are supported, textures like **'specular maps'** *(some of them)*, **'ink maps'**, **'normal maps'** *(some of them)* may not be converted by the tool properly. *(for the time being)* **However the majority of the regular color/diffuse/albedo and even alpha textures should be supported.**

## How to use?

**[This guides you on the interface of the application. (It's easy)](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/DDS-D3DTX-Converter/wiki/%5BHelp%5D-Application-Guide)**

**[This tutorial describes how to use the application](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/DDS-D3DTX-Converter/wiki/%5BTutorial%5D--How-to-make-a-Texture-Mod-(Part-1))**

**[This is how you can compile the modified textures into a Mod File](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/DDS-D3DTX-Converter/wiki/%5BTutorial%5D--How-to-make-a-Texture-Mod-(Part-2)).**
