# DDS-D3DTX-Converter

#### What is this?
**This is an experimental application** containing a WIP console script application for converting **.d3dtx textures (Telltale Tool Textures)**, to standard **.dds (Direct Draw Surface)**. 

It can also do the opposite and can be used to do texture mods for a Telltale Tool Game.

### When will you release it?
When this script improves and matures, I will turn it into a full on custom application complete with a GUI for better useability and release builds of said tool. For the time being if you wish to try this yourself you are welcome to download this project and run it yourself in the IDE (You will need Visual Studio Community 2020). It's worth mentioning at the time of writing, this is very new and bleeding edge. Expect bugs or issues as anything in the script is still very new.

**More information will be written and explained at a later date.** Currently focused on the functionality of the script but also understanding the .d3dtx format itself. *(I will also write another page explaining the extraction/building process and the d3dtx format for those intrested as well. Information is power!)*

### DISCLAIMER

**NOTE**: This is currently being developed and tested with ***"The Walking Dead Telltale Definitive Series".****
