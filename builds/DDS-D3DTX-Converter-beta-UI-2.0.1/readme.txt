In order to correctly build your file and avoid visual errors within the game, you need to properly save the .dds file after editing it.

Fist of all, you need to generate mip maps when saving the .dds file.

Secondly, the file has to be saved in the correct format.

To find out which format the .dds file has to be saved in, you need to check "mSurfaceFormat" parameter in the corresponding .json file. The parameter will contain a number. In order to learn, which format you need to save your file in, check the following table:
